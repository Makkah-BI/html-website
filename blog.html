          <p>
            I started Mctaba Labs on February 9th not knowing what to expect. I
            had watched a few youtube videos, tried freecodecamp for a week, but
            nothing prepared me for the real thing. Day One: We wrote our first
            Hello world. Simple, right? But in
            life, it felt electric.
          </p>

          <h4>Where I started:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I thought html was just putting text on a screen.</li>
            <li>I didn't know what git was;commit? push? what?.</li>
            <li>I'd never seen a merge conflict in my life.</li>
            <li>Tables were for spreadsheets, not websites.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>What changed in 7 days:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I can build a complete website from scratch,pure html.</li>
            <li>
              I understand semantic tags, header, main, article, section,
              footer.
            </li>
            <li>I use git every single day now and only panic a little.</li>
            <li>
              I've built 7 projects: flower shop, netflix clone, NGO site,
              recipe planner, e-commerce, airbnb clone, restaurant.
            </li>
            <li>
              I pushed everything to github and made my first public commits.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The best part? The community. Everyone is learning together,
            struggling together, and celebrating tiny wins together.
          </p>

          <p>Week one done. 29 weeks to go. Let's go.</p>

            <h3>Why semantic html matters</h3>
            <p><strong>Published:</strong> February 14, 2026· <em>Day 6</em></p>
          </header>

          <img
            src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555066931-4365d14bab8c?w=600&auto=format&fit=crop"
            alt="code on screen"
            width="500"
          />
          <p>
            When I first started, I used div for
            everything. Header? div. Navigation? div. Main content? div. Footer?
            also div. My code looked like a pile of boxes with no labels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then the teacher asked: "How does someone reading your code know
            what's what? How does a screen reader know where the navigation is?"
          </p>
          <p>That's when I discovered <strong>semantic html</strong>.</p>

          <h4>What I learned:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Header - for introductory content, logos,navigation
            </li>
            <li>
              Nav - specifically for navigation links
            </li>
            <li>
              main - the main content of the page
            </li>
            <li>
              article - self-contained content like blog posts
            </li>
            <li>section - groups related content</li>
            <li>aside - sidebar, related info</li>
            <li>
              <code>footer - bottom of page, copyright, contact
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Why it matters:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Accessibility:</strong> screen readers rely on semantic
              tags to navigate. a blind user can jump from header to main to
              footer because of these tags.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>SEO:</strong> search engines understand your content
              better. they know what's navigation vs what's the main article.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Readability:</strong> other developers (and future me) can
              read the code and understand the structure immediately.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Now I build every website with semantic tags. My NGO website has a
            header,nav,main with section for programs, article for each program, and a
            footer. It feels clean. It feels right.
          </p>

            <h3>The project I'm most proud of</h3>
            <p><strong>Published:</strong> February 15, 2026 · <em>Day 7</em></p>
          </header>

          <img

            alt="recipe planning"
            width="500"
          />

          <p>
            I've built 7 projects this week. Flower websites, netflix clones,
            e-commerce stores. But the one I keep coming back to? the
            <strong>recipe planner</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>Why? because it solves a real problem.</p>
          <p>
            Every day, people including me, stare into their fridge and ask
            "What's for dinner?" and then we order takeout or let food go bad.
            The recipe planner lets you track what's in your pantry, plan meals
            for the week and see what you can cook with what you have.
          </p>

          <h4>Features I built:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Pantry inventory:</strong> A table showing ingredients,
              quantities and expiry dates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weekly meal planner:</strong> A full table from monday to
              sunday with breakfast, lunch, dinner.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Popular recipes:</strong> Rcipes that are popular and easy to follow.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Substitution guide:</strong> What to use when you're
              missing an ingredient.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Food waste tracker:</strong> Showing how much waste you've
              prevented.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Why I'm proud:</h4>
          <p>
            This isn't just a clone. It's an original idea. I thought about what
            people actually need, and I built it. Yes, it's just html,
            but the structure is there. The thinking is
            there. When I add Javascript later, this will actually work.
