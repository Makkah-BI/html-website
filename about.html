          <h3>Before the bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            I just played around with free tutorials, watched videos, wondered
            if I could actually do this. Finally decided to take the leap.

        <h2>A few things about me</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I started coding exactly 5 days ago</li>
          <li>
            My first website took me 15 minutes. My second took a few more
            minutes. Is that still a progess?
          </li>
          <li>
            I've already broken things and fixed them again. That counts as
            experience, right?
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm documenting every win and every bug so I can look back and laugh
            about it in the future.
